## Sprint 10 – Advanced State Architecture

Sprint 10 was added to the existing ShopZone project instead of creating a separate application.

### What was added

- Redux Toolkit store with separate slices for cart, favorites, filters and theme
- Shopping cart mutations through Redux actions
- Favorites handled through Redux
- Multifacted Shop filters:
  - Search
  - Category
  - Price range
  - Minimum rating
  - Sorting
- Product grid updates immediately when global filters change
- `useMemo` used for category generation and filtered/sorted product results
- Dark/Light mode controlled by Redux
- Cart, favorites and theme saved to `localStorage`
- Redux DevTools support through Redux Toolkit's store configuration
- Responsive filter sidebar for smaller screens

### Run the project

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

For the Sprint 10 QA demo, open Redux DevTools and show a filter change, cart quantity update, favorite toggle and theme change. Refresh the browser to show that the saved state comes back from localStorage.

The original ShopZone pages and checkout flow are still used. Sprint 10 extends the existing project rather than replacing it.
